= Is Your Site Attacking Others? =

Use [Sucuri's WordPress DDOS Scanner](http://labs.sucuri.net/?is-my-wordpress-ddosing) to check if your site is DDOS’ing other websites

= Why Not Just Disable XMLRPC Altogether? =

Yes, you can choose to do that using the plugin [Disable XML-RPC](http://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-xml-rpc/), but if you use popular plugins like JetPack (that use XMLRPC) then those plugins will stop working 100%. That is why this small plugin exists.
