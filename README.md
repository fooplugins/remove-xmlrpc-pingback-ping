From sucuri.net:

> Any WordPress site with Pingback enabled (which is on by default) can be used in DDOS attacks against other sites.

Is Your Site Attacking Others?

Why Not Just Disable XMLRPC Altogether?
---------------------------------------

Yes, you can choose to do that using the plugin [Disable XML-RPC](http://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-xml-rpc/), but if you use popular plugins like JetPack (that use XMLRPC) then those plugins will stop working 100%. That is why this small plugin exists.

I did not write this code. I just put it together in a plugin so more people can easily install and use it. Original code from wptavern.com and sucuri.net in the links above.
